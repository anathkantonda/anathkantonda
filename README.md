## üöÄ About Me

<p>I'm a passionate and results-driven professional with a unique blend of experience in <strong>Software Engineering</strong> and <strong>Project Management</strong>. After a fulfilling period steering projects and leading teams, I'm enthusiastically returning to my roots in development, specifically focusing on becoming a proficient <strong>Frontend Developer</strong>.</p>

<p>True engineering excellence lies in building not just beautiful interfaces but also highly functional, performant, and maintainable web applications. My background in project management has instilled in me a strong understanding of product lifecycle, team collaboration, and delivering impactful solutions, which I now bring to my development work.</p>

<p>Currently, my goal is to leverage my renewed coding and professional skills to contribute as a Frontend Developer within my current company, focusing on innovative and user-centric web solutions.</p>

### Why Frontend?

<p>The immediate visual feedback, the intricate dance between design and code, and the direct impact on user interaction are what truly captivate me about frontend development. I thrive on the challenge of transforming complex ideas into seamless and delightful digital experiences.</p>
