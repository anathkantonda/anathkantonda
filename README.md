**anathkantonda/anathkantonda** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving myself as a Software Developer by working hard and well at work and also learning other skills on the side.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PHP. I had to teach myself PHP because that's what I use at work. I want to become very good at it and so everyday is an opportunity to learn.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with writing an ebook about the skills I know. I want to share with others about my journey to tech, the many downs I had, and the continuous ups I'll have from this point moving forward.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, seriously. If I know, I will help you. If I don't then I will happily point you to resources that may be of help.
