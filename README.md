### Hi there 👋

<!--
**anathkantonda/anathkantonda** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving myself as a Software Developer by working hard and well at work and also learning other skills on the side.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP. I had to teach myself PHP because that's what I use at work. I want to become very good at it and so everyday is an opportunity to learn.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with writing an ebook about the skills I know. I want to share with others about my journey to tech, the many downs I had, and the continuous ups I'll have from this point moving forward.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, seriously. If I know, I will help you. If I don't then I will happily point you to resources that may be of help.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love playing the Sims 4... and Monopoly... and Chess.
